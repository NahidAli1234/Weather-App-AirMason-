# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


In the project directory, you can start the server by running the code in the terminal:

npm start

*Disclaimer* 
Make sure that Node and Npm are downloaded or the server will not start

This can be done by going to their website
https://nodejs.org/en/download 

Once the download is completed, in the terminal or Command Prompt, the follow lines can be executed to check the version of each.

node -v
npm -v


*ADDITIONAL INFORMATION SECTION*

Axios was used to run this program and also for the API function. Before you start this project you will need to install Axios.

Axios can be download from the terminal by using this command
            npm install axios or npm i axios

To use the APIs listed with OpenWeather, a API key is needed that is personal to you. This can be obtained when creating an account with OpenWeather and I recommend you do so, since everyone's code is specific and will take a couple of hours to be activated once creating an account with OpenWeather.
